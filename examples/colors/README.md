This example is a copy-paste with slight modifications of code from therepository
https://github.com/jonathaneunice/colors/, and is not developed by Codium.

It is intended to demonstrate test generation capabilities.

Please try to create tests for the file
```
colors.py
```

The reason for the copy-and-change is that AI models are trained on open-source repositories, and
because of that they are familiar with the tests written for this specific code, so to demonstrate
capabilities the code must be modified enough so that the model does not "recognize" it.
